# Hospital Patient Records Analysis ‚Äî Tableau Dashboard

This project showcases an end-to-end analysis of hospital patient records using Tableau. Given a raw dataset containing patient encounters, procedures, demographics, and cost details, I cleaned and transformed the data to create a professional, high-level KPI dashboard for hospital stakeholders.

The dashboard is designed to provide quick insights into patient trends, healthcare costs, insurance coverage, and demographics ‚Äî helping decision-makers monitor performance and uncover opportunities for improvement.

## Project Overview

**Objective:**  
To analyze hospital patient records and build an interactive Tableau dashboard that helps answer key operational and strategic questions, such as:

- How many patients have been admitted or readmitted over time?
- What is the average stay duration for patients?
- How much does each visit cost, on average?
- How many procedures are covered by insurance?
- What are the demographics of the patient population?

---

## Key Insights

- Admission trends show fluctuations that may indicate seasonal patterns or resource bottlenecks.
- Average stay duration is low, suggesting a high volume of outpatient visits.
- Encounter costs vary significantly across different encounter types.
- A majority of procedures are covered by insurance, though some gaps exist.
- Patient population is demographically diverse across race, age, and gender.

## Dashboard Features

The final Tableau dashboard includes:

-  **KPIs**: Total patients, stay duration, average cost per visit, insured procedures, and insurance count.
-  **Operational Trends**: Admission rates over time, encounter types, and cost analysis.
-  **Demographics**: Gender breakdown, race distribution, and age category segmentation.
-  **Export Options**: Easily export visuals to PNG or PowerPoint for presentations.

## Tools & Techniques

- **Tableau**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Calculated Fields**: Derived metrics such as age groups, insurance coverage, and admission status
- **Data Cleaning**: Regex for name cleanup, logic for filtering procedures, date difference calculations, and more
